"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, The","On the afternoon of August 18, 1973, five young people in a Volkswagen van
   ran out of gas on a farm road in south Texas. Four of them were never seen
   again. The next morning the one survivor, Sally Hardesty Annright, was 
   picked up on a roadside, blood-caked and screaming murder. Sally said she
   had broken out of a window in Hell. The girl babbled a mad tale. A cannibal
   family in an isolated farmhouse. Chainsawed fingers and bones. Her brother,
   her friends, hacked up for barbecue. Chairs made of human skeletons. Then
   she sank into catatonia. Texas lawmen mounted a month-long manhunt, but 
   could not locate the macabre farmhouse. They could find no killers and no
   victims. No facts. No crime. Officially, on the records, the Texas Chainsaw
   Massacre never happened. But during the last thirteen years, over and over
   again, reports of bizarre grisly chainsaw mass murders have persisted all
   across the state of Texas. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has not stopped. It
   haunts Texas. It seems to have no end. @ 0:00","Mortician","Chainsaw Dismemberment","Chainsaw Dismemberment "

"Nixon, Richard M. (President)","The president speaks from the oval office
  Good evening. This is the 37th time I've spoken to you from this office
   where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this
   nation. Each time I've done so to discuss with you some matters that I
   believed affected the national interest. In all the decisions I've made in
   my public life, I've always tried to do what was best for the nation. As
   long as there was such a base, I've felt strongly that it was nessesary to
   see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do
   otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult
   process. But with the disappearance and the dangerously destabilizing
   precedent for the future, I've concluded that because of the Watergate
   matter, I might not have the support of the congress, that I'd consider
   nessesary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of
   this office in the way the interest of the nation would require.
  I have never been a quitter!
  To leave office before my term is completed is apart to every instinct in
   my body.
  and let peace then settle at last over the middle east, and so that the
   caddle of civilization will not become its grave.
  These years have been a momentous time in the history of our nation and of
   the world. They've been a time of achivement and .. we can all be proud.
   Achivements that represents the shared efforts of the administration, the
   congress and the people.
  May God's grace be with you, in all the days ahead.
  Day in and day out
  The White House
  mistakes yes, but for personal gains never!
  The cause bigger than yourself. It's the cause of making this the greatest
   nation in the world, the leader of the world, because without our
   leadership, the world would know nothing but war, possibly starvation or
   worse, in the years ahead.
  But most important, we must be strong here, strong in our hearts, strong in
   our souls, strong in our beliefs and strong in our willingness to sacrifice
   in a peculiar way.
  Not in this administration, not one single man or woman
  ... strong, Sometimes wrong, sometimes right, but he was a man.
  Always remember: Others may hate me
  and then destroy yourself
  I want to say that not only will we always remember you, not only will we
   always be grateful, always you'll be in our hearts and you'll be in our
   prayers.
  Those who hate me don't win, unless you're with them

   courtrooms. All you have is confusion in your courtrooms. Why do I have to
   stand and take the blame for your sins again? I've spent my life in jail,
   paying for you, so that you could ride your bicycle, have your birthday
   parties, have what you'd call a life. You know, I never had a life. I don't
   even know what life is, you know. I go to the desert, I'm not even allowed
   to live in your desert. I'm no good for anything except to be used, as your
   scapegoat. I'm used. Every day of my life, I've been used. When I haven't
   been used, and I have been on the - on the street, I've been chased, run,
   harassed, pushed, kicked, my ribs have been broken. You know, the same man
   that gives you a traffic ticket is the same guy that knocks my brains out.
   He figures just because he's the man, he can get away with it cause nobody's
   gonna say anything. My daddy's not a congressman, a doctor, or a lawyer.
  They are sneaking in the county jail looking under the door to see if the
   man is there. Sneaking like little children out of town. Sneaking all around
   the courthouse. Sneaking in and out of the ventilators. Sneaking everywhere
   Everything is sneaky up around Sneakyville. Everything we have to do to get
   the truth has to be sneaky, and it's even a shame to sneak to get to the
   truth, to make the truth such an evil dirty old nasty thing. You gotta sneak
   to get to the truth; the truth is condemned. The truth is in the gas
   chamber. The truth has been in your stockyards, your slaughterhouses. The
   truth has been in your reservations, building your railroads, emptying your
   garbage. The truth is in your ghettos, and your jails, and your young love.
   Not in your courts or your congress where the old sit judgement on the
   young. What the hell do the old know about the young? You put a picture of
   old George on the dollar and tell ya that he's your father worship him.
  Look at the madness that goes on. You can't prove anything that happened
   yesterday. Now is the only thing that's real. You can try to prove that
   Columbus sailed on an ocean, but it's not the same ocean; it's a different
   ocean. It's a different world. Every day, every reality is a new reality.
   Every new reality is a - is a new horizon, a brand-new experience of living.
   I got a note last night from a friend of mine. He writes in his note that
   he's afraid of what he might have to do in order to save his reality, as I
   saved mine. You can't prove anything; there's nothing to prove. Every man
   judges himself. He knows what he is. You know what you are as I know what I
   am. We all know what we are. Nobody can stand in judgement they can play
   like they're standing in judgement. They can play like they stand in
   judgement and take you off and control the masses with your human body and
   they can lock you up in penitentiaries and cages and put you on crosses like
   they did in the past. But it doesn't amount to anything. What they're doing
   is, they're only persecuting our affliction of themselves. They're
   persecuting what they can't stand to look at in themselves: the truth! They
   can't stand to look at the truth in themselves, they persecute themselves.
   They're butchering themselves every time they go on the freeway. They hate
   themselves. Look at the signs. Stop, go, turn here, turn there, you can't do
   this, you can't do that, you can't, you can't, you can't, this is illegal,
   that's illegal, everything's illegal. The police used to watch over the
   people; now they're watching the people. The president doesn't represent the
   people; he could be on the roadside picking up his children but he isn't.

   is. Am I being clear? For to examine these concepts requires tremendous

"Vietnam Requiem (Documentary)","They fought the longest war in American history.
  In 1965 Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war, but it wasn't. It was
   different in many ways, and so were those who did the fighting. In World 
   War II the average age of the combat soldier was 26. In Vietnam he was 19.
  19
  The heaviest fighting of the past two weeks continued today 25 miles 
   northwest of Saigon.
  I wasn't really sure what was going on.
  In Vietnam the combat soldier typicaly served a twelve month tour of duty 
   but was exposed to hostile fire almost every day.
  In Saigon a US military spokesman said today more than 700 enemy troops were
   killed last week in that sensitive border area. Throughout all of South-
   Vietnam the enemy lost a total of 2689 soldiers.
  You're 18 years old and you're wearing somebody's brains around on your 
   shirt because they got their heads blown off right next to you ... and 
   that's not supposed to affect you ... I can never understand. What would 
   scare me, is if we were to send a group of 18-year olds 1200 miles away, 
   and subject them to a year of that insanity, and have them not be affected.
   That's what would frighten me.
  According to a Veteran's Administration study, half of the Vietnam combat 
   veterans suffer from what psychiatrists call post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Many vets complain of alienation, rage or guilt. Some succumb to suicidal 
   thoughts. Eight to ten years after coming home, almost 800,000 men are still
   fighting the Vietnam War.
  None of them received a hero's welcome

  Are you not familiar with the book of Revelations of St. John, the final
   book of the Bible prophesied the apocalypse? @ 0:28
  He forced everyone to receive a mark on his right hand and on his forehead,
   so that no one shall be able to buy or sell unless he has the mark, which
   is the name of the beast and the number of his name and the number of the
    beast is 666. @ 0:36
  What can such a specific prophesy mean? @ 0:51
  What is the mark? @ 0:57
  The mark is the barcode, the ubiquitous barcode, that you'll find on every
   bog roll and every packet of Johnnies and every poxy pork pie. Every
   barcode is divided into two parts by three markers, those three markers
   always represented by the number 6 6 6 6. @ 1:07
  Now what does it say? No one shall be able to buy or sell without that mark.
   And now what they're planning to do in order to eradicate all credit card
   fraud, in order to precipitate a totally cashless society, what they're
   planning to do they've already tested on the American troops, they're going
   to subcutaneous laser tattoo a mark onto your right hand or onto your
   forehead. They're going to replace plastic with flesh. Fact! @ 1:39
  In the same book of Revelations when the Seven Seals were broken open on
   the Day of Judgment, when the seven angels blow the trumpets and third 
   angel blows up wormwood, wormwood will fall from the sky. Wormwood will 
   poison the third part, and all the waters in the third part and all the 
   land and many many many people will die. Now do you know what the Russian
   translation of wormwood is? Chernobyl. Fact! @ 3:04
  On August the 18th, 1999 the planets of our solar system are going to line
   up into the shape of a cross. @ 3:47
  They're going to line up in the fixed signs of Aquarius, Leo, Taurus and
   Scorpio. Which just happen to correspond to the four beasts of the
   Apocalypse as mentioned in the book of Daniel. Another fact! @ 4:07
  Do you think that the amoeba ever dreamed it would evolve into the frog.
   And when that first frog shimmied out of the water and employed it's vocal
   cords in order to attract a mate onto the turn of gravity, did that frog
   ever imagine that the insignificant call would evolve into all the 
   languages of the world into all the literature of the world? And just as
   that froggie could never have conceived of Shakespeare so we can not
   possibly imagine our destiny. Look, if you take the whole of time and 
   represent it by one year, were only in the first few moments of the first
   of January. There's a long way to go. Only now were not going to spout 
   extra limbs and wings and fins because evolution itself is evolving. When
   it comes, the apocalypse itself will be part of the process of that leap
   of evolution. By the very definition of apocalypse, mankind must cease to
   exist, at least in a material form. We'll evolve into something that
   transcends matter, into a species of pure thought. Are you with me? @ 6:57

   semitic, anti-Korean and basically a perpetrator of violence because of your

    talk a little bit about that too because we sort of had a discussion about
    this last time.'

    Do you think that sometimes those images and those lyrics help white folks
    justify their continual racism against us, this continuous racism against 
    us?'
   'No.'
  I speak in a perspective as brothers on what we need to do is look in the 
   mirror. I do want the white community to understand our community more and 
   see what's going on and see what, what the things they have done to us in 
   the past are still affecting us now, mentally, you know, and...
  'The reason I say it is because, I mean, everything I've said about, you 
    know, everything I've said on records before the riot, you know, anything 
    you want to know about the riots was in the records before the riots. All

  I was a bum at San Francisco that once managed to go to a symphony concert

   about the audience was not. And something about the orchestra and the 
   conductor was not. Although the building was fine and the acoustic 's
   perfect I prefered to listen to the music alone on my radio. And afterwards
   I did go back to my room. I turned on the radio. But there was a pounding on
   the wall. 'Shut that god damn thing off.' There was a soldier in the next 
   room bubbling with his wife and soon he would go over there to protect me
   from Hitler. So I snapped the radio off and then I heard his wife say 'You
   shouldn't have done that'. And the soldier said 'Fuck that guy' which I 
   thought was a very nice thing for him to tell his wife to do. Of course she 
   never did. Anyhow I never went to another live concert. At that night I 
   listened to the radio very quietly

   was an accident. 9:03: another airliner hits the Trade Center south tower,
   an explosion bursting from the building's upper floors. (Note: Newsreader)
  Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center @ 0:29 (Note: George
   W Bush)
  President Bush called the crashes an apparent terrorist attack.  9:45: 
   another; a commercial plane crashes into the Pentagon.  9:51: taking no
   chances, the Federal Aviation Administration grounds all take-offs and
   landings and re-routes incoming international flights to Canada, and the
   Pentagon soon upgrades its terrorist alert status to Delta, the highest
   possible level.  10 am: back in New York, the Trade Center south tower
   crumbles to the ground.  10:29: the north tower collapses. These buildings
   were once the tallest in the world. Lower Manhattan, home of the city's
   financial district, is shrouded in smoke, dust and ash. 10:10 am, a half
   hour earlier: United flight 93 bound from Newark, New Jersey to San
   Francisco crashes into western Pennsylvania. Police there say initial
   reports suggest <??>>.  In Washington, the Departments of Justice, State,
   Treasury and Defence were among those ordered to evacuate as were the
   Capitol and the White House. In New York, major businesses, the stock
   exchanges were evacuated. All tunnels and bridges into and out of the city
   were shut down. The United Nations was evacuated as a precaution. Hundreds,
   perhaps thousands of people are feared hurt or killed in what is clearly the
   worst ever terrorist attack on the United States. @ 0:33 (Note: Newsreader)
  The free American people will not be intimidated, nor will we be defeated. 
   We will find the people responsible for these cowardly acts and justice will
   be done. @ 3:07  (Note: Colin Powell???)
  Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under
   attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were
   in airplanes, were in their offices; secretaries, businessmen and women,
   military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors.
   Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror.
   The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge... 
   huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness
   and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to
   frighten our nation into chaos and retreat, but they have failed. Our
   country is strong. A great people has been moved to defend a great nation.
   Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings but
   they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel but
   they cannot dampen the steel of American resolve. America's target for
   attack has been the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the

"Fagan, Myron C. (Author)","#1: Use monetary and sex bribery to obtain control of men already in high
   places in the various levels of all governments and other fields of
   endeavors. Once influential persons have fallen for the lies deceits and
   temptations for the illuminati, they were to be held in bondage by
   application of political and other forms of blackmail. Threats for financial
   ruin, public exposure and threats of physical harm, even death to themselves
   and other loved ones in their family. Do you realize how many top officials
   in our federal govt in Washington are controlled in just that way by the
   CFR? Do you realize how many homosexuals in our state department, the
   Pentagon, all federal agencies, even in The Whitehouse are controlled that
   way?
  #2: Illuminati and the faculties of colleges and universities were to
   cultivate students possessing exceptional mental ability belonging to well
   bred families with international means and reccomend them for special
   training in internationalism. Such training was to be provided by granting
   scholorships to those selected by the illuminists. All such scholors were
   first be pursuaded and then convinced that men with special talents and
   brains have the right to rule those less gifted on the grounds that the
   masses don't know what's best for them physically, mentally and
   spiritually.
  #4: To obtain absolute control over the press at that time the only mass
   communications media to distribute information to the public. So that all
   news and information could be slanted so that the masses could be convinced
   that a one world government is the only solution to  our many and varied
   problems.
  Now do you know who owns and controls our mass comunications media? I'll
   Tell you practically all the lots in Hollywood is owned by the laymans <???>
   and Company, Goldman-Sachs and other internationalist bankers. All the
   national radio and TV channels in the nation are owned and controlled by
   those same internationalist bankers. The same is true of every chain of
   metropolitan newspapers and magazines. Also of the press wire services such
   as Associated Press. United Press International, etc. The supposed heads of
   all those media are merely the fronts of the internationalist bankers who in
   turn compose a hierarcy of the CFR, today's illuminati in america. Now can
   you understand why the Pentagon's press agent Sylvester so brazenly
   proclaimed that the government has the right to lie to the people. What he
   really meant was that our CFR controlled government had the power and lie to
   and be believed by the brainwashed american people.

   sun-rays/Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven/Swartest
   night stretched over wretched men there./The ocean flowing backward, came we
   then to the place/Aforesaid by Circe./Here did they rites, Perimedes and
   Eurylochus,/And drawing sword from my hip/I dug the ell-square pitkin;/
   Poured we libations unto each the dead,/First mead and then sweet wine,
   water mixed with white flour./Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly
   death's-heads;/As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best/For sacrifice,
   heaping the pyre with goods,/A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a
   bell-sheep./Dark blood flowed in the fosse,/Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous
   dead, of brides/Of youths and of the old who had borne much;/Souls stained
   with recent tears, girls tender,/Many men, mauled with bronze lance heads,/
   Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms,/These many crowded about me; with
   shouting,/Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;/Slaughtered the
   herds, sheep slain of bronze;/Poured ointment, cried to the gods,/To Pluto
   the strong, and praised Proserpine;/Unsheathed the narrow sword,/I set to
   keep off the impetuous impotent dead,/Till I should hear Tiresias./But first
   Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,/Unburied, cast on the wide earth,/Limbs
   that we left in the house of Circe,/Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since
   toils urged other./Pitiful spirit @ 0:20 (Note: The poet Ezra Pound reading

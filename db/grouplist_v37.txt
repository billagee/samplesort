   incapable of distinguishing between the real and the vividly imagined

   mind. They are catalogued and recorded, and either acted upon directly, or

   is. Am I being clear? For to examine these concepts requires tremendous

  "On the afternoon of August 18, 1973, five young people in a Volkswagen van
   ran out of gas on a farm road in south Texas. Four of them were never seen
   again. The next morning the one survivor, Sally Hardesty Annright, was 
   picked up on a roadside, blood-caked and screaming murder. Sally said she
   had broken out of a window in Hell. The girl babbled a mad tale. A cannibal
   family in an isolated farmhouse. Chainsawed fingers and bones. Her brother,
   her friends, hacked up for barbecue. Chairs made of human skeletons. Then
   she sank into catatonia. Texas lawmen mounted a month-long manhunt, but 
   could not locate the macabre farmhouse. They could find no killers and no
   victims. No facts. No crime. Officially, on the records, the Texas Chainsaw
   Massacre never happened. But during the last thirteen years, over and over
   again, reports of bizarre grisly chainsaw mass murders have persisted all
   across the state of Texas. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has not stopped. It

  "Also the pastor said, 'Stop, preacher! The boy's trying to tell you

   He said, 'That boy is telling you he was born blind... But when you prayed 
   that prayer, _in_the_name_of_Jesus_, the lights came on for the first time 
   in twelve years, and now that blind boy can see.' I didn't know this! And 
   the next night, you couldn't get near that stadium. I never saw such a crowd
   in my life - twenty-thousand people outside that couldn't get in - the 
   government sent over workers - I could tell 'em because I saw the guns - 
   that were in their - in in their - in in their coat pockets - I could see 
   the bulging. And-and-and God even saved them and delivered them and set them
   free. This_is_what_America_needs!  This is what Africa needs! This is what 
   India needs!  This - We are needed in the troubled spots in the world! We 
   don't need more government intervention - we need a Holy Ghost Revival to 
   let the world know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and 
   forever! It will bring life to a nation! I believe we're living in the hour
   when whole nations are going to come to Jesus Christ. Can you shout 'Amen' -
   I believe this with all of my heart! Hallelujah!"

   believed affected the national interest. In all the decisions I've made in
   my public life, I've always tried to do what was best for the nation. As
   long as there was such a base, I've felt strongly that it was nessesary to
   see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do
   otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult
   process. But with the disappearance and the dangerously destabilizing
   precedent for the future, I've concluded that because of the Watergate

   nessesary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of

   about the audience was not. And something about the orchestra and the 
   conductor was not. Although the building was fine and the acoustic 's
   perfect I prefered to listen to the music alone on my radio. And afterwards
   I did go back to my room. I turned on the radio. But there was a pounding on
   the wall. 'Shut that god damn thing off.' There was a soldier in the next 
   room bubbling with his wife and soon he would go over there to protect me
   from Hitler. So I snapped the radio off and then I heard his wife say 'You
   shouldn't have done that'. And the soldier said 'Fuck that guy' which I 
   thought was a very nice thing for him to tell his wife to do. Of course she 
   never did. Anyhow I never went to another live concert. At that night I 
   listened to the radio very quietly"

   the head, the woman's head. He had severed it from the trunk, built a huge 
   fire in the sitting room and placed her head upon it. Then, then the storm 
   broke with a violent flash of lightning and an appalling crash of thunder. 
   As the head of Emily Kaye lay upon the coals, the dead eyes opened and Mahon
   fled out to the deserted shore. When he nerved himself to return, the fire 
   had done its work."

  "You lost your head. And having lost your head, you left the lady's body in

  "They fought the longest war in American history."
  "In 1965 Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war, but it wasn't. It was
   different in many ways, and so were those who did the fighting. In World 
   War II the average age of the combat soldier was 26. In Vietnam he was 19."
  "19"
  "The heaviest fighting of the past two weeks continued today 25 miles 
   northwest of Saigon."
  "I wasn't really sure what was going on."
  "In Vietnam the combat soldier typicaly served a twelve month tour of duty 
   but was exposed to hostile fire almost every day."
  "In Saigon a US military spokesman said today more than 700 enemy troops were
   killed last week in that sensitive border area. Throughout all of South-
   Vietnam the enemy lost a total of 2689 soldiers."
  "You're 18 years old and you're wearing somebody's brains around on your 
   shirt because they got their heads blown off right next to you ... and 
   that's not supposed to affect you ... I can never understand. What would 
   scare me, is if we were to send a group of 18-year olds 1200 miles away, 
   and subject them to a year of that insanity, and have them not be affected.
   That's what would frighten me."
  "According to a Veteran's Administration study, half of the Vietnam combat 
   veterans suffer from what psychiatrists call post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Many vets complain of alienation, rage or guilt. Some succumb to suicidal 
   thoughts. Eight to ten years after coming home, almost 800,000 men are still
   fighting the Vietnam War."

   sun-rays/Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven/Swartest
   night stretched over wretched men there./The ocean flowing backward, came we
   then to the place/Aforesaid by Circe./Here did they rites, Perimedes and
   Eurylochus,/And drawing sword from my hip/I dug the ell-square pitkin;/
   Poured we libations unto each the dead,/First mead and then sweet wine,
   water mixed with white flour./Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly
   death's-heads;/As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best/For sacrifice,
   heaping the pyre with goods,/A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a
   bell-sheep./Dark blood flowed in the fosse,/Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous
   dead, of brides/Of youths and of the old who had borne much;/Souls stained
   with recent tears, girls tender,/Many men, mauled with bronze lance heads,/
   Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms,/These many crowded about me; with
   shouting,/Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;/Slaughtered the
   herds, sheep slain of bronze;/Poured ointment, cried to the gods,/To Pluto
   the strong, and praised Proserpine;/Unsheathed the narrow sword,/I set to
   keep off the impetuous impotent dead,/Till I should hear Tiresias./But first
   Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,/Unburied, cast on the wide earth,/Limbs
   that we left in the house of Circe,/Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since
   toils urged other./Pitiful spirit" @ 0:20 (Note: The poet Ezra Pound reading

   I  wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I
   want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And
   then I realized... Like I was shot... Like I was shot with a diamond... a

   an explosion bursting from the building's upper floors." (Note: Newsreader)

   chances, the Federal Aviation Administration grounds all take-offs and
   landings and re-routes incoming international flights to Canada, and the
   Pentagon soon upgrades its terrorist alert status to Delta, the highest
   possible level.  10 am: back in New York, the Trade Center south tower
   crumbles to the ground.  10:29: the north tower collapses. These buildings
   were once the tallest in the world. Lower Manhattan, home of the city's
   financial district, is shrouded in smoke, dust and ash. 10:10 am, a half
   hour earlier: United flight 93 bound from Newark, New Jersey to San
   Francisco crashes into western Pennsylvania. Police there say initial
   reports suggest <??>>.  In Washington, the Departments of Justice, State,
   Treasury and Defence were among those ordered to evacuate as were the
   Capitol and the White House. In New York, major businesses, the stock
   exchanges were evacuated. All tunnels and bridges into and out of the city
   were shut down. The United Nations was evacuated as a precaution. Hundreds,
   perhaps thousands of people are feared hurt or killed in what is clearly the
   worst ever terrorist attack on the United States." @ 0:33 (Note: Newsreader)

   attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were
   in airplanes, were in their offices; secretaries, businessmen and women,
   military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors.
   Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror.
   The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge... 
   huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness
   and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to
   frighten our nation into chaos and retreat, but they have failed. Our
   country is strong. A great people has been moved to defend a great nation.
   Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings but
   they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel but
   they cannot dampen the steel of American resolve. America's target for
   attack has been the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the
   world and no-one will keep that light from shining." @ 4:29  (Note: George W

  "#1: Use monetary and sex bribery to obtain control of men already in high
   places in the various levels of all governments and other fields of
   endeavors. Once influential persons have fallen for the lies deceits and
   temptations for the illuminati, they were to be held in bondage by
   application of political and other forms of blackmail. Threats for financial
   ruin, public exposure and threats of physical harm, even death to themselves
   and other loved ones in their family. Do you realize how many top officials
   in our federal govt in Washington are controlled in just that way by the
   CFR? Do you realize how many homosexuals in our state department, the
   Pentagon, all federal agencies, even in The Whitehouse are controlled that
   way?"
  "#2: Illuminati and the faculties of colleges and universities were to
   cultivate students possessing exceptional mental ability belonging to well
   bred families with international means and reccomend them for special
   training in internationalism. Such training was to be provided by granting
   scholorships to those selected by the illuminists. All such scholors were
   first be pursuaded and then convinced that men with special talents and
   brains have the right to rule those less gifted on the grounds that the
   masses don't know what's best for them physically, mentally and
   spiritually."
  "#4: To obtain absolute control over the press at that time the only mass
   communications media to distribute information to the public. So that all
   news and information could be slanted so that the masses could be convinced
   that a one world government is the only solution to  our many and varied
   problems."
  "Now do you know who owns and controls our mass comunications media? I'll
   Tell you practically all the lots in Hollywood is owned by the laymans <???>
   and Company, Goldman-Sachs and other internationalist bankers. All the
   national radio and TV channels in the nation are owned and controlled by
   those same internationalist bankers. The same is true of every chain of
   metropolitan newspapers and magazines. Also of the press wire services such
   as Associated Press. United Press International, etc. The supposed heads of
   all those media are merely the fronts of the internationalist bankers who in
   turn compose a hierarcy of the CFR, today's illuminati in america. Now can
   you understand why the Pentagon's press agent Sylvester so brazenly
   proclaimed that the government has the right to lie to the people. What he
   really meant was that our CFR controlled government had the power and lie to
   and be believed by the brainwashed american people."

   Foreign Relations. This was recorded on three LP records in the late 1960's
   and are now available on a number of sites on the Internet. These samples
   were split into the right, the left and the center channels and were played
   simultanteosly.)

= Truth; Transparent
  "The truth has not been in your courtrooms, never has been in your
   courtrooms. All you have is confusion in your courtrooms. Why do I have to
   stand and take the blame for your sins again? I've spent my life in jail,
   paying for you, so that you could ride your bicycle, have your birthday
   parties, have what you'd call a life. You know, I never had a life. I don't
   even know what life is, you know. I go to the desert, I'm not even allowed
   to live in your desert. I'm no good for anything except to be used, as your
   scapegoat. I'm used. Every day of my life, I've been used. When I haven't
   been used, and I have been on the - on the street, I've been chased, run,
   harassed, pushed, kicked, my ribs have been broken. You know, the same man
   that gives you a traffic ticket is the same guy that knocks my brains out.
   He figures just because he's the man, he can get away with it cause nobody's
   gonna say anything. My daddy's not a congressman, a doctor, or a lawyer."
  "They are sneaking in the county jail looking under the door to see if the
   man is there. Sneaking like little children out of town. Sneaking all around
   the courthouse. Sneaking in and out of the ventilators. Sneaking everywhere
   Everything is sneaky up around Sneakyville. Everything we have to do to get
   the truth has to be sneaky, and it's even a shame to sneak to get to the
   truth, to make the truth such an evil dirty old nasty thing. You gotta sneak
   to get to the truth; the truth is condemned. The truth is in the gas
   chamber. The truth has been in your stockyards, your slaughterhouses. The
   truth has been in your reservations, building your railroads, emptying your
   garbage. The truth is in your ghettos, and your jails, and your young love.
   Not in your courts or your congress where the old sit judgement on the
   young. What the hell do the old know about the young? You put a picture of
   old George on the dollar and tell ya that he's your father worship him."
  "Look at the madness that goes on. You can't prove anything that happened
   yesterday. Now is the only thing that's real. You can try to prove that
   Columbus sailed on an ocean, but it's not the same ocean; it's a different
   ocean. It's a different world. Every day, every reality is a new reality.
   Every new reality is a - is a new horizon, a brand-new experience of living.
   I got a note last night from a friend of mine. He writes in his note that
   he's afraid of what he might have to do in order to save his reality, as I
   saved mine. You can't prove anything; there's nothing to prove. Every man
   judges himself. He knows what he is. You know what you are as I know what I
   am. We all know what we are. Nobody can stand in judgement they can play
   like they're standing in judgement. They can play like they stand in
   judgement and take you off and control the masses with your human body and
   they can lock you up in penitentiaries and cages and put you on crosses like
   they did in the past. But it doesn't amount to anything. What they're doing
   is, they're only persecuting our affliction of themselves. They're
   persecuting what they can't stand to look at in themselves: the truth! They
   can't stand to look at the truth in themselves, they persecute themselves.
   They're butchering themselves every time they go on the freeway. They hate
   themselves. Look at the signs. Stop, go, turn here, turn there, you can't do
   this, you can't do that, you can't, you can't, you can't, this is illegal,
   that's illegal, everything's illegal. The police used to watch over the
   people; now they're watching the people. The president doesn't represent the
   people; he could be on the roadside picking up his children but he isn't. 
   He's in the White House sending them off to war. And you're saying I have to
   pay for this again, and again and again: I've gotta pay for your sins. How
   many times have I gotta pay for your sins? I'm getting tired. I'm getting
   tired."

   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former
   slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together
   at a table of brotherhood. I have a dream. I have a dream that one day down
   in Alabama with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips
   dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right
   there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join
   hands with the little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I
   have a dream. When we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from
   every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all
   of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants
   and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old
   Negro spiritual: 'Free at last, free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are

  "The Hindenburg left Frankfurt, Germany yesterday, sorry tuesday, 7.30 their
   time, and for the better than two & a half days they have been speeding 
   through the skies over miles and miles of water here to America. Now they 
   are coming in to make a landing of the zeppelin. At this point I'm going to
   step out here and cover it from the outside, so as I move out... we'll 
   stand by a second. Well, here it comes ladies & gentlemen, we're out now, 
   outside the hangar, and what a great sight it is, a thrilling one, its a 
   marvellous sight, as it comes down out of the sky, pointing directly toward
   us and toward the mooring mast, the mighty vehicle coming down now... the
   huge propellers scything the air and throwing it back  into a gale-like
   whirlpool. No wonder this floating palace has moved with such speed with'
   these powerful motors behind it. The field wasn't active when we arrved but
   the field has become a moving mass of cooperative action, with the landing
   crews and mooring crews, with orders being passed along, and last minute
   preparations are being completed for the moment we've waited for so long. 
   The ship is riding majestically toward us like some great feather, riding
   as though it were mighty proud to take its place in the world of aviation.
   The ship is no doubt bustling with activity as we can see, the pasengers
   are lining the windows looking down toward us and getting a glimpse of
   the mooring mast. Its practically standing still now as they have dropped
   ropes out of the nose of the ship and these have been taken ahold of down
   here on the field by a number of men... It's starting to rain again, the
   rain has dragged up a little bit. The vast motors of the ship are just 
   holding it enough to keep it --- It's bursting into flames!!! - Get it 
   Scotty, get it!!! It's terrible!!!  Oh my get out of the way please... 
   Its burning, bursting into flames and falling onto the field. Oh this is
   terrible, one of the worst catastrophes the world has ever  seen... The 
   flames are rising 4 to 5 hundred feet into the sky, its a terrific blaze 
   ladies & gentlemen, the smoke and the flames now, the ship  crashing to
   the ground and not quite into the mooring mast... oh the humanity... all 
   the passengers... it's it's... oh... I... I... I can't talk ladies & 
   gentlemen, honestly... A great mass of smoking wreckage and everybody can
   hardly breathe... I'm sorry.. I... I... I can hardly breathe... I'm going 
   to step inside where I cannot see it. Listen folks, I'm going to have to 
   stop for a minute because this is the worst thing I've ever witnessed..."

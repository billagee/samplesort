   of horror. Horror and moral terrorare your friends. If they are not then
   they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies. I remember when I
   was with Special Forces... Seems a thousand centuries ago... We went into a
   camp to innoculate the children. We left the camp after we had innoculated
   the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us and he was
   crying. He couldn't see. We went back there and they had come and hacked 
   off every innoculated arm. There they were in a pile... A pile of little
   arms. And I remember... I... I... I cried... I wept like some grandmother.
   I  wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I
   want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And
   then I realized... Like I was shot... Like I was shot with a diamond... a 
   diamond bullet right  through my forehead... And I thought: My God...the
   genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete,
   crystalline, pure.  And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because
   they could stand that these were not monsters... These were men... trained
   cadres... these men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had
   children, who were filled with love...but they had the strength...the 
   strength...to do that." (Note: Basically the whole Brando monologue)

    the mud and the blood and he's fightin' and dyin' for you and then you come
    over and you spit in his face, what kinda fuckin' country could that be? 
    You see what I'm sayin'?  Does that make sense?'

   'You know, so it's the same thing all the way down the line. All the way 
    down the line that, uh, uh, people think it's slick to get over on 
    somebody else because they're in a down position, and they find their 
    strength by, by sacrificing their own lands.  But they're not sacrificing
    the lands of their enemies.  They're only sacrificing their own children.
    They're sacrificing their children for somebody else's children. My
    grandfather told me this. He didn't tell me exactly, but he told my
    grandmother and I know she'd never lied. She told me, he told my
    grandmother that he was standing on a, in World War I, he was standin' on
    a dead body. And he, and, and he seen the Bible in this guy's pocket and
    he reached down and he got the Bible out of this guy's pocket. And he
    opened up the Bible and there was the man's picture with his wife and his
    two, three children, ya dig? And he had a chain with a cross on it, and he
    looked at the Bible and he looked at the man's children and he looked at
    the cross and he looked down and he seen himself. He said, Wow man, what
    am I doing fighting my brother? I'm over here fighting my brother and I
    don't even know why I'm fighting this guy, ya dig?  Why have we been
    fighting each other? Why are we divided? Why is our house all split up in
    little pieces? Why are we divided within ourself? We worship the same god,
    we have the same book with the same words. Different translations, but the
    same principles, same codes of honor. Why in the Hell are we fightin' each
    other? Why did my grandfather kill himself? He comes back and tells my
    grandmother, you know, I was fighting my brothers and I don't even know
    why. And they didn't know why. And you want me to tell you why?'" @ 0:24

   us feel like we're older. Rick asks if we wanna go party and Laura says
   yes, and all of a sudden I feel this knot building up in my stomach. But
   when Laura gets in the truck with Rick, I go anyway. A stream in the 
   woods and when I think, it's pale and light out. Laura starts to dance 
   around the boys. She begins to move her hips. And we take off our clothes.
   I know the boys are watching. Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick. I don't
   know what to do, so I swim away. I feel like I want to run, but I don't.
   He kisses my hand and then me. I can still feel that kiss. His lips are

  "On the afternoon of August 18, 1973, five young people in a Volkswagen van
   ran out of gas on a farm road in south Texas. Four of them were never seen
   again. The next morning the one survivor, Sally Hardesty Annright, was 
   picked up on a roadside, blood-caked and screaming murder. Sally said she
   had broken out of a window in Hell. The girl babbled a mad tale. A cannibal
   family in an isolated farmhouse. Chainsawed fingers and bones. Her brother,
   her friends, hacked up for barbecue. Chairs made of human skeletons. Then
   she sank into catatonia. Texas lawmen mounted a month-long manhunt, but 
   could not locate the macabre farmhouse. They could find no killers and no
   victims. No facts. No crime. Officially, on the records, the Texas Chainsaw
   Massacre never happened. But during the last thirteen years, over and over
   again, reports of bizarre grisly chainsaw mass murders have persisted all
   across the state of Texas. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has not stopped. It

  "The president speaks from the oval office"
  "Good evening. This is the 37th time I've spoken to you from this office
   where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this
   nation. Each time I've done so to discuss with you some matters that I
   believed affected the national interest. In all the decisions I've made in
   my public life, I've always tried to do what was best for the nation. As
   long as there was such a base, I've felt strongly that it was nessesary to
   see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do
   otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult

  "The truth has not been in your courtrooms, never has been in your
   courtrooms. All you have is confusion in your courtrooms. Why do I have to
   stand and take the blame for your sins again? I've spent my life in jail,
   paying for you, so that you could ride your bicycle, have your birthday
   parties, have what you'd call a life. You know, I never had a life. I don't
   even know what life is, you know. I go to the desert, I'm not even allowed
   to live in your desert. I'm no good for anything except to be used, as your
   scapegoat. I'm used. Every day of my life, I've been used. When I haven't
   been used, and I have been on the - on the street, I've been chased, run,
   harassed, pushed, kicked, my ribs have been broken. You know, the same man
   that gives you a traffic ticket is the same guy that knocks my brains out.
   He figures just because he's the man, he can get away with it cause nobody's
   gonna say anything. My daddy's not a congressman, a doctor, or a lawyer."
  "They are sneaking in the county jail looking under the door to see if the
   man is there. Sneaking like little children out of town. Sneaking all around
   the courthouse. Sneaking in and out of the ventilators. Sneaking everywhere
   Everything is sneaky up around Sneakyville. Everything we have to do to get
   the truth has to be sneaky, and it's even a shame to sneak to get to the
   truth, to make the truth such an evil dirty old nasty thing. You gotta sneak
   to get to the truth; the truth is condemned. The truth is in the gas
   chamber. The truth has been in your stockyards, your slaughterhouses. The
   truth has been in your reservations, building your railroads, emptying your
   garbage. The truth is in your ghettos, and your jails, and your young love.
   Not in your courts or your congress where the old sit judgement on the
   young. What the hell do the old know about the young? You put a picture of
   old George on the dollar and tell ya that he's your father worship him."
  "Look at the madness that goes on. You can't prove anything that happened
   yesterday. Now is the only thing that's real. You can try to prove that
   Columbus sailed on an ocean, but it's not the same ocean; it's a different
   ocean. It's a different world. Every day, every reality is a new reality.
   Every new reality is a - is a new horizon, a brand-new experience of living.
   I got a note last night from a friend of mine. He writes in his note that
   he's afraid of what he might have to do in order to save his reality, as I
   saved mine. You can't prove anything; there's nothing to prove. Every man
   judges himself. He knows what he is. You know what you are as I know what I
   am. We all know what we are. Nobody can stand in judgement they can play
   like they're standing in judgement. They can play like they stand in
   judgement and take you off and control the masses with your human body and
   they can lock you up in penitentiaries and cages and put you on crosses like
   they did in the past. But it doesn't amount to anything. What they're doing
   is, they're only persecuting our affliction of themselves. They're
   persecuting what they can't stand to look at in themselves: the truth! They
   can't stand to look at the truth in themselves, they persecute themselves.
   They're butchering themselves every time they go on the freeway. They hate
   themselves. Look at the signs. Stop, go, turn here, turn there, you can't do
   this, you can't do that, you can't, you can't, you can't, this is illegal,
   that's illegal, everything's illegal. The police used to watch over the
   people; now they're watching the people. The president doesn't represent the
   people; he could be on the roadside picking up his children but he isn't. 
   He's in the White House sending them off to war. And you're saying I have to
   pay for this again, and again and again: I've gotta pay for your sins. How
   many times have I gotta pay for your sins? I'm getting tired. I'm getting
   tired."

  "Psychologically speaking, the human mind, or brain, or whatever, is almost 
   incapable of distinguishing between the real and the vividly imagined 
   experience - sound and film, music and radio. Even these manipulated 
   experiences are received more or less directly and uninterpreted by the 
   mind. They are catalogued and recorded, and either acted upon directly, or 
   stored in the memory, or both. Now, this process, unless we pay it 
   tremendous attention, begins to separate us from the reality of the now. Am
   I being clear?" @ 0:00
  "The psychologically tested belief of our time is that the central nervous
   system, which feeds its impulses directly to the brain - the conscious and 
   subconscious - is unable to discern between the real and the vividly 
   imagined experience, if there is a difference, and most of us believe there
   is. Am I being clear? For to examine these concepts requires tremendous
   energy and discipline. To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires
   clarity. Where there is clarity, there is no choice, and where there is
   choice, there is misery. But then why should anyone listen to me? Or should
   I speak? Since I know nothing..." @ 5:00 (Note: The original actually

   And when that first frog shimmied out of the water and employed it's vocal
   cords in order to attract a mate onto the turn of gravity, did that frog
   ever imagine that the insignificant call would evolve into all the 
   languages of the world into all the literature of the world? And just as
   that froggie could never have conceived of Shakespeare so we can not
   possibly imagine our destiny. Look, if you take the whole of time and 
   represent it by one year, were only in the first few moments of the first
   of January. There's a long way to go. Only now were not going to spout 
   extra limbs and wings and fins because evolution itself is evolving. When
   it comes, the apocalypse itself will be part of the process of that leap
   of evolution. By the very definition of apocalypse, mankind must cease to
   exist, at least in a material form. We'll evolve into something that
   transcends matter, into a species of pure thought. Are you with me?" @ 6:57

   she wrote scrolling on the paper. In this film she would write "u" instead
   of you, or "luv" instead of love, erasing the mistakes, every once in awhile
   scribbling or doodling, until she finally spells it right, then breathes a

  "The Soldier his wife and the bum"
  "I was a bum at San Francisco that once managed to go to a symphony concert 
   along with the well dressed people. And the music was good but something 
   about the audience was not. And something about the orchestra and the 
   conductor was not. Although the building was fine and the acoustic 's
   perfect I prefered to listen to the music alone on my radio. And afterwards
   I did go back to my room. I turned on the radio. But there was a pounding on
   the wall. 'Shut that god damn thing off.' There was a soldier in the next 
   room bubbling with his wife and soon he would go over there to protect me
   from Hitler. So I snapped the radio off and then I heard his wife say 'You
   shouldn't have done that'. And the soldier said 'Fuck that guy' which I 
   thought was a very nice thing for him to tell his wife to do. Of course she 
   never did. Anyhow I never went to another live concert. At that night I 
   listened to the radio very quietly"
  "War has it's price and peace never lasts. And Millions of young men 
   everywhere will die. As I'd listening to the classical music I heard them
   making love. Desperatly and mournfuly to <???> Brahms, Mozart, <???> and 
   Climax and through the shared walls of our darkness."

   the head, the woman's head. He had severed it from the trunk, built a huge 
   fire in the sitting room and placed her head upon it. Then, then the storm 
   broke with a violent flash of lightning and an appalling crash of thunder. 
   As the head of Emily Kaye lay upon the coals, the dead eyes opened and Mahon
   fled out to the deserted shore. When he nerved himself to return, the fire 
   had done its work."

   was an accident. 9:03: another airliner hits the Trade Center south tower,
   an explosion bursting from the building's upper floors." (Note: Newsreader)
  "Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center" @ 0:29 (Note: George
   W Bush)
  "President Bush called the crashes an apparent terrorist attack.  9:45: 
   another; a commercial plane crashes into the Pentagon.  9:51: taking no
   chances, the Federal Aviation Administration grounds all take-offs and
   landings and re-routes incoming international flights to Canada, and the
   Pentagon soon upgrades its terrorist alert status to Delta, the highest
   possible level.  10 am: back in New York, the Trade Center south tower
   crumbles to the ground.  10:29: the north tower collapses. These buildings
   were once the tallest in the world. Lower Manhattan, home of the city's
   financial district, is shrouded in smoke, dust and ash. 10:10 am, a half
   hour earlier: United flight 93 bound from Newark, New Jersey to San
   Francisco crashes into western Pennsylvania. Police there say initial
   reports suggest <??>>.  In Washington, the Departments of Justice, State,
   Treasury and Defence were among those ordered to evacuate as were the
   Capitol and the White House. In New York, major businesses, the stock
   exchanges were evacuated. All tunnels and bridges into and out of the city
   were shut down. The United Nations was evacuated as a precaution. Hundreds,
   perhaps thousands of people are feared hurt or killed in what is clearly the
   worst ever terrorist attack on the United States." @ 0:33 (Note: Newsreader)
  "The free American people will not be intimidated, nor will we be defeated. 
   We will find the people responsible for these cowardly acts and justice will
   be done." @ 3:07  (Note: Colin Powell???)
  "Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under
   attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were
   in airplanes, were in their offices; secretaries, businessmen and women,
   military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors.
   Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror.
   The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge... 
   huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness
   and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to
   frighten our nation into chaos and retreat, but they have failed. Our
   country is strong. A great people has been moved to defend a great nation.
   Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings but
   they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel but
   they cannot dampen the steel of American resolve. America's target for
   attack has been the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the
   world and no-one will keep that light from shining." @ 4:29  (Note: George W

  "#1: Use monetary and sex bribery to obtain control of men already in high
   places in the various levels of all governments and other fields of
   endeavors. Once influential persons have fallen for the lies deceits and
   temptations for the illuminati, they were to be held in bondage by
   application of political and other forms of blackmail. Threats for financial
   ruin, public exposure and threats of physical harm, even death to themselves
   and other loved ones in their family. Do you realize how many top officials
   in our federal govt in Washington are controlled in just that way by the
   CFR? Do you realize how many homosexuals in our state department, the
   Pentagon, all federal agencies, even in The Whitehouse are controlled that
   way?"
  "#2: Illuminati and the faculties of colleges and universities were to
   cultivate students possessing exceptional mental ability belonging to well
   bred families with international means and reccomend them for special
   training in internationalism. Such training was to be provided by granting
   scholorships to those selected by the illuminists. All such scholors were
   first be pursuaded and then convinced that men with special talents and
   brains have the right to rule those less gifted on the grounds that the
   masses don't know what's best for them physically, mentally and
   spiritually."
  "#4: To obtain absolute control over the press at that time the only mass
   communications media to distribute information to the public. So that all
   news and information could be slanted so that the masses could be convinced
   that a one world government is the only solution to  our many and varied
   problems."
  "Now do you know who owns and controls our mass comunications media? I'll
   Tell you practically all the lots in Hollywood is owned by the laymans <???>
   and Company, Goldman-Sachs and other internationalist bankers. All the
   national radio and TV channels in the nation are owned and controlled by
   those same internationalist bankers. The same is true of every chain of
   metropolitan newspapers and magazines. Also of the press wire services such
   as Associated Press. United Press International, etc. The supposed heads of
   all those media are merely the fronts of the internationalist bankers who in
   turn compose a hierarcy of the CFR, today's illuminati in america. Now can
   you understand why the Pentagon's press agent Sylvester so brazenly
   proclaimed that the government has the right to lie to the people. What he
   really meant was that our CFR controlled government had the power and lie to
   and be believed by the brainwashed american people."

   come into my chin and into my nose. And when I woke up, my body was all

  "Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day's end./Sun to his
   slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean,/Came we then to the bounds of deepest
   water,/Covered with close-webbed mist,unpierced ever/With the glitter of
   sun-rays/Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven/Swartest
   night stretched over wretched men there./The ocean flowing backward, came we
   then to the place/Aforesaid by Circe./Here did they rites, Perimedes and
   Eurylochus,/And drawing sword from my hip/I dug the ell-square pitkin;/
   Poured we libations unto each the dead,/First mead and then sweet wine,
   water mixed with white flour./Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly
   death's-heads;/As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best/For sacrifice,
   heaping the pyre with goods,/A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a
   bell-sheep./Dark blood flowed in the fosse,/Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous
   dead, of brides/Of youths and of the old who had borne much;/Souls stained
   with recent tears, girls tender,/Many men, mauled with bronze lance heads,/
   Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms,/These many crowded about me; with
   shouting,/Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;/Slaughtered the
   herds, sheep slain of bronze;/Poured ointment, cried to the gods,/To Pluto
   the strong, and praised Proserpine;/Unsheathed the narrow sword,/I set to
   keep off the impetuous impotent dead,/Till I should hear Tiresias./But first
   Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,/Unburied, cast on the wide earth,/Limbs
   that we left in the house of Circe,/Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since
   toils urged other./Pitiful spirit" @ 0:20 (Note: The poet Ezra Pound reading
